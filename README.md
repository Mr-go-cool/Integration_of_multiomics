# Integration_of_multiomics
Integrating multiomics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) using the multiGSEA package to perform pathway-centric analysis. This approach enables a comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and cellular responses by leveraging the GSEA method for combined analysis of genes, proteins, and metabolites.

**multiGSEA Workflow: Three Key Steps**
**Preparing Pathways and Omics Data:**
multiGSEA compiles pathway definitions for various omics data (e.g., genes, proteins, metabolites) from multiple sources like KEGG and Reactome, which may use different identifier formats. To ensure consistency, the graphite package standardizes these identifiers into a unified format. This harmonization allows seamless pathway analysis across different omics layers.

**Single-Omics Gene Set Enrichment Analysis:**
Each omics dataset is analyzed separately to assess pathway enrichment. By examining gene expression, protein activity, or metabolite levels individually, this step identifies which pathways are significantly active under a given condition or treatment.

**Integrated Multi-Omics Enrichment Analysis:**
After separate analyses, multiGSEA integrates results from transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to provide a holistic view of cellular responses. By combining insights across omics layers, this approach reveals complex interactions between genes, proteins, and small molecules, uncovering biological mechanisms that may be overlooked in single-omics studies.
